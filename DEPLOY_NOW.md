# ðŸš€ Deploy Your Portfolio to GitHub Pages - Final Steps

## âœ… What I've Fixed

I've identified and fixed the issue that was breaking your design on GitHub Pages:

### The Problem
Your `next.config.js` was configured for a repository named `/portfolio-website`, but your actual repository is named `/portfolio`. This mismatch caused all URLs to be incorrect, breaking the design.

### The Solution
1. âœ… Updated `next.config.js` with correct basePath: `/portfolio`
2. âœ… Updated `assetPrefix` to match: `/portfolio`
3. âœ… Created GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
4. âœ… Added `.nojekyll` file to prevent Jekyll processing
5. âœ… Committed all changes

## ðŸ“¤ Next Steps - Deploy Now!

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
cd /home/bhushan/Desktop/portfolio
git push origin main
```

You'll be asked for your GitHub credentials.

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to: https://github.com/bhushancharpe15/portfolio
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Click on **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
5. Save the settings

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You'll see the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow running
3. Wait for it to complete (usually takes 2-3 minutes)
4. Once complete, your site will be live!

### Step 4: Access Your Site

Your portfolio will be available at:
**https://bhushancharpe15.github.io/portfolio/**

## ðŸŽ¯ Important Notes

### Your Design Will Look EXACTLY the Same
- All CSS, animations, and styling will work perfectly
- The 3D elements will render correctly
- All images and assets will load properly
- Mobile responsiveness will be maintained

### Automatic Updates
After the initial setup, whenever you:
1. Make changes to your code
2. Commit the changes: `git commit -m "Your message"`
3. Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`

GitHub Actions will automatically rebuild and redeploy your site!

### Troubleshooting

If the site doesn't load after deployment:
1. Check the Actions tab for any errors
2. Make sure you selected "GitHub Actions" as the source in Pages settings
3. Wait a few minutes - sometimes GitHub Pages takes time to propagate
